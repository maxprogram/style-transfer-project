# Style Transfer Project


## Initializing from scratch

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
mkdir inputs
mkdir output
```

* Image size -- makes image more detailed but also closer to original
* Style scale -- increases similarity to style
* Pooling type -- "avg" makes it look better
* Content weight -- seemingly no effect
* Content loss type -- no effect
* Model -- try vgg19
